# LadderApp

## Description: A small game application for home use that stores the results of games and displays statistics for all games. It has a small game interface like a chess clock.

### Requirements:
* Implement rankings view which lists users in order of their ranking (by number of games played, games won)
* MVVM

### Technology Stack:
* SwiftUI
* Combine
* CoreData
* UserDefaults

* Navigation Coordinator with NavigationPath and NavigationStack

## Ways to improve:
* Usage FireBase against CoreData
* UIScreens for notify players about successful end of game
* Add game timer and match time
* Can be updated by sounds
* Animations for Users actions can be added for better involvement

* Consider better architecture approach
* MVVM is not good enough for SwiftUI
* Consider better usage for CoreData
